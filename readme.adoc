# JBangHub Catalog for ProGuard 

This catalog contains scripts for working with ProGuard.
You can use these scripts to run ProGuard and its GUI without having to install them directly.

You can find more information about JBang at https://jbang.dev

General documentation for ProGuard is at https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/quickstart

## Usage

The JBangHub Catalog for ProGuard includes several aliases that you can use to run different ProGuard tools directly. These aliases are defined in the `jbang-catalog.json` file and can be executed using JBang.

Here are the available aliases:

- `retrace@jbanghub/proguard`: Runs the ProGuard ReTrace tool.
- `proguard@jbanghub/proguard`: Runs the ProGuard tool.
- `proguard-gui@jbanghub/proguard`: Runs the ProGuard GUI.

To run any of these aliases directly, you can use the following commands:

```bash
jbang <alias>@jbanghub/proguard <scriptOrFile>
```

or install the alias using `jbang app install <alias>@jbanghub/proguard`

For example to install and run the ProGuard GUI:

```bash
jbang app install proguard-gui@jbanghub/proguard
proguard-gui 
```
